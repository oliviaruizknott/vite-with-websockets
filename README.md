# vite-with-websockets

I’m learning Vite and refreshing my knowledge of WebSockets.

## Setup

1. Clone the project.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. See the project on http://localhost:5173/

Note: To see this locally on my phone, I added `--host` to the `dev` script. ([This post](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/3396) helped me figure it out, though I think I’m missing something from [the documentation here](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html).) To see it on your own phone, make sure your computer and phone are on the same WiFi, then [find your computer’s local IP address](https://www.avast.com/c-how-to-find-ip-address#topic-3). On your phone, navigate to <your local ip>:5173

# Other notes

- This is where I started: https://vitejs.dev/guide/
- This project is configured to use React.
- I followed [this YouTube tutorial to set up WebSockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FduLSXEHLng), but I’m a bit skeptical since it’s 2 years old. Are there better, more recent practices I should be using?
